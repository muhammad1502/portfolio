# Muhammad Abdullah: portfolio

Personal portfolio for **Muhammad Abdullah**, Security Operations Analyst. It's a
single-page, static site designed in the style of apple.com, with light/dark
themes and subtle scroll animations. Live at
**https://mabddullah.vercel.app**.

## Stack

| Layer    | Choice                                                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Build    | [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) 8                                      |
| UI       | React 19 + TypeScript                                             |
| Styling  | One plain stylesheet, `src/styles/site.css` (CSS custom properties) |
| Motion   | CSS transitions + IntersectionObserver (no animation library)     |
| Icons    | [`lucide-react`](https://lucide.dev) (GitHub and LinkedIn marks in `brand-icons.ts`) |
| Font     | SF Pro via the system stack on Apple devices; self-hosted Inter elsewhere (`@fontsource-variable/inter`) |
| Hosting  | Vercel (Git-connected, auto-deploy on push to `main`)            |

There is no router and no backend: it's a static single page, pre-rendered to
HTML at build time and hydrated in the browser. All content is data-driven
from a single TypeScript file.

## Editing content

**All resume content lives in
[`src/app/components/resume-data.ts`](src/app/components/resume-data.ts)**:
profile, contacts, experience, projects, skills and certifications. The React app
imports and renders it; the components are generic and never hardcode copy.

Edit `resume-data.ts` directly. The types (`ResumeEntry`, `Role`, `SkillGroup`,
`Certification`, etc.) are defined at the top of the file and enforce the
structure of each entry: TypeScript will flag a malformed entry at build time
(`npm run build`).

Each experience entry supports optional `bullets` (string list),
`sections` (labeled paragraphs), `roles` (sub-positions), `href` (adds a
"View on GitHub" / "Visit website" button) and `stats` (big animated numbers on
the tile). Entries with `sections`, `bullets` or `roles` get a **Learn more**
button that opens the full detail in a modal. Text wrapped in
`**double asterisks**` in any body string (including `profile.about`) renders
emphasized.

A project can also carry an optional `writeup` (a `ResumeEntry` with `sections`).
Its card then gets a **Read write-up** button that opens it in the same modal.

> `stats` should only restate figures that already appear in that entry's copy.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build      # type-check, client build, server build, then scripts/prerender.mjs
                   # bakes the page HTML (and an Inter preload) into dist/index.html
npm run preview    # serve the production build locally
```

Requires **Node 20.19+ or 22.12+** (what Vite 8 needs; pinned via `engines` in `package.json`).

## Design & theming

- Modelled on apple.com: values (type scale, colours, 44px blurred nav, pill
  buttons, breakpoints 734 / 833 / 1068px) are taken from apple.com's own
  stylesheets and documented at the top of [`site.css`](src/styles/site.css).
- Every CTA uses one button size (44px tall); buttons in a pair are equal width.
- Light/dark tokens live on `:root` / `:root[data-theme='dark']` in `site.css`.
  The choice is stored in `localStorage` (`theme-mode`) and otherwise follows the
  OS `prefers-color-scheme`.
- An inline script in `index.html` sets `data-theme` and the background **before
  React mounts**, so dark-mode users never see a light flash (FOUC).
- All content renders immediately (no fade-in or scroll-reveal). Motion only
  decorates what is already on screen. Desktop: a ⌘K / Ctrl+K quick-actions
  palette (jump to a section, download the CV, copy email with a toast, open
  LinkedIn/GitHub, switch theme), a slight cursor tilt on cards and hover to
  replay a stat's count-up. Everywhere: scroll-linked effects (cards and
  headlines settle into place, the hero recedes, About text lights up word by
  word as you read), count-up stats, a back-to-top button with a
  reading-progress ring, a current-section marker (sliding underline in the
  nav, a dot in the phone menu, sticky section chips on phones), a terminal-style
  `whoami` line in About, a cursor spotlight and lift on cards, a tap ripple and press-in on
  touch screens, a phone bottom-sheet for details (swipe down to close), a
  swipeable Projects carousel with page dots on phones, light haptic ticks on
  Android, a crossfade between themes
  (View Transitions, with a colour-fade fallback) with a sun-to-moon icon
  morph, and small button hover glows. Under `prefers-reduced-motion` all
  movement is off; the theme crossfade stays because a fade has no motion.

## Assets & images

- The profile photo (`src/imports/muhammad-abdullah.jpg`) is **EXIF-stripped**
  (GPS/device metadata removed) and resized to 384px: it displays at 144px in a
  circular avatar. To swap it, replace that file (keep it small; Vite hashes and
  emits it into `dist/assets/`). If the image is ever missing, the avatar falls
  back to the `MA` initials monogram (see [`Hero.tsx`](src/app/components/Hero.tsx)).
- Favicon, apple-touch-icon, and the OG image live in `public/` (NOT `dist/`,
  `dist/` is wiped and rebuilt on every Vercel deploy).
- `public/resume.pdf` is the downloadable CV. It is generated from the `/?print`
  layout ([`PrintResume.tsx`](src/app/components/PrintResume.tsx)), which reads the
  same `resume-data.ts` as the site, so the two never disagree. The layout is a
  single column with standard headings so applicant tracking systems parse it
  in order. To regenerate after editing content: `npm run build && npm run preview`,
  open `http://localhost:4173/?print` in Chrome, Print, Save as PDF (paper size
  Letter, margins Default, headers and footers off), and replace `public/resume.pdf`.

## Deploy (Vercel)

Connected to this GitHub repo. **Every push to `main` triggers a production build.**
All config is in [`vercel.json`](vercel.json):

- Framework `vite`, build `npm run build`, output `dist`
- No rewrites: the site is a single page, so unknown paths return a real 404
  (`public/404.html`)
- `Cache-Control: immutable` (1 year) on hashed `/assets/*`
- Security headers: a strict CSP (`script-src 'self'`, no inline scripts; the
  pre-paint theme script lives in `public/theme-init.js`), `X-Frame-Options:
  DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Permissions-Policy` and
  `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`. Vercel adds HSTS and the HTTP to HTTPS redirect.
- `public/.well-known/security.txt` (RFC 9116) lists the security contact. Update
  its `Expires` date before 2027-09-28. `SECURITY.md` points GitHub's Security
  tab to the same contact, and `.github/dependabot.yml` opens weekly grouped
  dependency-update PRs.

> **Domain note:** absolute URLs (OG image, canonical, JSON-LD, sitemap, robots,
> llms.txt, security.txt, the CV) point to the live domain `https://mabddullah.vercel.app`.
> The original `muhammad-abdullah-resume.vercel.app` permanently redirects (308) there.
> If a custom domain is added later, update those references across `index.html`
> and `public/` (`sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`).

## SEO & AI readability

- **Meta**: title, description, Open Graph + Twitter cards, canonical, theme-color.
- **JSON-LD `Person` schema** in `index.html`: gives search engines and AI
  crawlers structured facts (name, role, employer, skills, socials).
- **`robots.txt`** explicitly allows search and AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot,
  PerplexityBot, Google-Extended) and points to the sitemap.
- **`llms.txt`**: a plain-text profile summary for LLM crawlers, so AI answers
  about "Muhammad Abdullah" stay accurate.

To preview share cards: [opengraph.xyz](https://www.opengraph.xyz) or
[metatags.io](https://metatags.io). Platforms cache OG data hard: use their
debuggers (LinkedIn Post Inspector, Facebook Sharing Debugger) to force a re-scrape.
